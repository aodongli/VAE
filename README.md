# VAE
* run vae\_jaan.ipynb and see results in ./log/
* The version of tensorflow is 1.1.0 (under which I run it).
* To run the model, just focus on \`\`vae_jaan.py''. Set the directory parameters and run it.
* \`\`vae.py'' is an **uncomplished** version but vae_jaan.py is enough and simple.
* vae_jaan.py is a simplified version of JAAN ALTOSAAR's. 
* I removed some fancy part of the code and made it more straightforward. The code only includes very basic, easy-understood tf's api. There are not complex ones (which I don't understand and are roughly documented).
